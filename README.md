# DataScienceWithPython

## Get started with Data Science with Python
An engaging introduction to [Data Science](https://www.learnpythonwithrune.org/data-science-2/) with Python

## TL;DR
- Download all Jupyter Notebooks from repo ([zip-file-download](https://github.com/LearnPythonWithRune/DataScienceWithPython/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)).
- Unzip download (main.zip) appropriate place.
- Launch Ananconda and start JuPyter Notebook ([Install it from here if needed](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual))
- Open the first Notebook from download.
- Start watching the first video lesson ([YouTube](INSERT LINK)).

## Why most fail with Data Science?
- Focus on getting good at all technical aspects:
  - Math
  - Stat
  - Python
  - R
  - Machine Learning
  - pandas
  - NumPy
  - PyTorch
...and the list could go on and dive into each category (you get the point)

**This is the wrong way to learn!**

## Understand the Data Science Workflow
![Data Science Workflow](img/ds-workflow.png)
- Understanding what matters
  - The full flow
  - How to add value to customers
- Focus how to add value with simple setup - then you get far
- Later you can become expert in any of it
- But you should first understand the *WHY!*

This course will cover all aspects of it with the focus to get you there as fast as possible!
